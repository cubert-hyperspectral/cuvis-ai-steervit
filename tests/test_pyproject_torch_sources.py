"""Guard the torch index pins in ``pyproject.toml`` and the CI lock (the cuvis-ai pattern).

A local ``uv sync`` takes torch and torchvision from a PyTorch wheel index through the ``cuda``
dependency group: aarch64 Linux (Jetson Thor, CUDA 13) from cu130, every other platform from cu128.
Both entries stay scoped to the ``cuda`` group, so an environment that installs this plugin as a
path or git dependency (a cuvis.next child environment) inherits no index pin. The committed lock
is the CI lock: CI runs ``uv run --no-sources --locked``, so the lock must resolve torch from PyPI.
The base requirements are split along the same markers, because uv assigns an explicit index
only to a requirement inside one resolver fork.
